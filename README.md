# twitch-tools

This repo is going to be the place where I share useful tools for streaming on twitch, starting with funny chatbot commands and possibly other scripts.

Check out the [nightbot commands](./nightbot-commands.md) document for a list of fun and useful nightbot commands and building blocks.

Feel free to add more commands to the file with pull requests!

Most of these commands were created for my own twitch channel at [twitch.tv/caitelatte](https://twitch.tv/caitelatte) or for others who I moderated for but haven't asked if they're ok with being named here!

## Bot recommendations

Bots I (over)use on my own stream:

* [streamelements bot](https://streamelements.com/caitelatte/commands): some commands, counters which I can access through the overlays.
  * You can set it up to use a custom alt or your own name through the streamelements live plugin.
  * There's fun modules like the loyalty points and duels/gambling, and you can set it to use those loyalty points for on stream rewards, but i haven't really touched that.
* [nightbot](https://nightbot.tv/t/caitelatte/commands): so many commands, i especially use it because I can embed fun javascript in commands.
  * Pretty similar to streamelements tbh, you should only need one of them.
* [buttsbot](https://www.twitch.tv/buttsbot): haha funny butt word swaps (you can set the word and frequency)
* [stayhealthybot](https://stayhealthybot.com/#commands): 2-hourly reminders to drink water and stretch and take a break, you can set frequency. nice lil reminder!
* [botbegone](https://www.twitch.tv/botbegone): extremely good bot made by ComplexPlane which autobans big follows spam bots
* [commanderroot](https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/follower_remover.php): you don't have to do anything with this one, but if you get follow botted (get a large number of robot follows) you can use it to remove those follows. They also have a proactive blocklist if you want to use that, but it takes quite a few hours of having the browser tab open to go through and block them.
