# twitch-tools

This repo is going to be the place where I share useful tools for streaming on twitch, starting with funny chatbot commands and possibly other scripts.

Check out the [nightbot commands](./nightbot-commands.md) document for a list of fun and useful nightbot commands and building blocks.

Feel free to add more commands to the file with pull requests!

Most of these commands were created for my own twitch channel at [twitch.tv/caitelatte](https://twitch.tv/caitelatte) or for others who I moderated for but haven't asked if they're ok with being named here!
